# BFS solver by clickednebula3, Fractal Maze by Mark J. P. Wolf

I used Breadth First Search method to solve Mark J. P. Wolf's Fractcal Maze.<br/>

I recommend running via `node --max-old-space-size=8192 index.js` for more ram.<br/>
Read each solution from its bottom to its top.<br/>
Change the number of steps directly from the constant in index.js (Default: 30).
